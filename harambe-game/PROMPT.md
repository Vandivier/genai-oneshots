# king bananu game

let's make an rpg game that solves the debate around:
100 men vs 1 gorilla
vs 100 americans vs 100 british people
vs aliens vs predators
vs vampires vs werewolves
vs zombies

The trick is...these memes never specified *WHICH GORILLA*

that's where our game comes into play. the gorilla is King Bananu. let main player character be king bananu the gorilla (inspired by harambe the gorilla meme lore).

- let's make this a web-based game.
- this is a single player game.
- you can create any kind of monsters and abilities that you want. define them statically for now.
- use typescript types.
- let it reflect traditional rpg style, similar to final fantasy or dragon quest. there should be safe town maps, a world map, dungeon maps, equipment, and split-panel battle screens
- when the game starts, users should be able to select between "New Game" or "Load Saved Game"
- during the game, users should be able to save any time. there should be five save slots.
- the world should be seeded and procedurally generated.
- there should be a leveling and experience system
- think step-by-step to define additional
- you need to put the code in the correct location. let the package.json file be a sibling of PROMPT.md (the current file you are reading now) or the child of a sibling folder that you create
- use Phaser <phaser.io> and ensure controls to move around the world are visible to the user. implement the actual game, not just a work in progress. If you will require multiple prompts to complete the game, that's fine just let me know to say "continue" or whatever you think I should say, or ask a question if you would like my input (as game co-creator)
- initially, King Bananu is the last surviving Gorilla on the planet. His town has been assaulted by humans. As a warrior-king, he led on the front lines, but the humans broke through. He and his fellow warriors returned to the town to get their families to flee once more, only to find humans had conducted a pincer attack from both sides, the villagers were all dead, and King Bananu and three soldiers were the only living gorillas, and they are now surrounded. King Bananu sees his dead child and wife, and grows insanely angry, getting super powered with Bananu rage magic. King Bananu's teammates are ultimately killed as well, though they fight bravely and kill many humans...leaving only King Bananu against the last 100 men where our first battle game scene picks up...
