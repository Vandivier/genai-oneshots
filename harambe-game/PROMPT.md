# harambe game

let's make an rpg game that solves the debate around:
100 men vs 1 gorilla
vs 100 americans vs 100 british people
vs aliens vs predators
vs vampires vs werewolves
vs zombies

The trick is...these memes never specified *WHICH GORILLA*

that's where our game comes into play. the gorilla is harambe. let main player character be harambe the gorilla.

- let's make this a web-based game.
- this is a single player game.
- you can create any kind of monsters and abilities that you want. define them statically for now.
- use typescript types.
- let it reflect traditional rpg style, similar to final fantasy or dragon quest. there should be safe town maps, a world map, dungeon maps, equipment, and split-panel battle screens
- when the game starts, users should be able to select between "New Game" or "Load Saved Game"
- during the game, users should be able to save any time. there should be five save slots.
- the world should be seeded and procedurally generated.
- there should be a leveling and experience system
- think step-by-step to define additional
- you need to put the code in the correct location. let the package.json file be a sibling of PROMPT.md (the current file you are reading now) or the child of a sibling folder that you create
- use Phaser <phaser.io> and ensure controls to move around the world are visible to the user. implement the actual game, not just a work in progress. If you will require multiple prompts to complete the game, that's fine just let me know to say "continue" or whatever you think I should say, or ask a question if you would like my input (as game co-creator)
