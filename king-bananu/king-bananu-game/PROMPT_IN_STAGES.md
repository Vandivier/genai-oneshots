# king bananu game - prompt in stages

## phase 1 - base game

Make a 2D RPG game, cloning Dragon Quest. use procedural generation. let the user navigate with WASD or on-screen arrows that can be clicked. W should move north on the map. spawn random monsters.

## phase 2 - stats and leveling

Introduce stats and leveling. Add a menu icon so that the player can open the menu and view character name, level, and stats. let the name just be "King Bananu"

## phase 3 - towns and dungeons

Let's add town tiles and dungeon tiles that allow the user to enter those maps from the world map. They should have an exit so the player can return to the world map.

## phase 4 - battle scenes

When the player encounters an enemy on a tile, randomly decide that they win or lose. Lose shows a game over screen and win grants experience points.
